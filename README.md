# California Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict housing prices in California using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The California housing dataset contains features such as median income, housing median age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, and more for districts in California. We will use this dataset to train machine learning models to predict housing prices.
